To run the AI model on a separate process or thread, you can use the multiprocessing or threading library in Python. Here's a basic example of how to achieve this using the threading library:

Import the necessary libraries:
```
import threading
import socket
```
Define the AI model function:
Create a function that handles the AI model's tasks, such as loading the model, processing user requests, and returning responses.

```
def ai_model_function(request_queue, response_queue):
    # Load the AI model here
    # ...

    while True:
        # Get the next request from the request queue
        request = request_queue.get()

        # Process the request using the AI model
        response = process_request_with_ai_model(request)

        # Put the response into the response queue
        response_queue.put(response)
```

Create a main server function:
Define the main server function that will handle incoming connections and exchange data with the AI model function.

```
def main_server_function(request_queue, response_queue):
    # Set up the socket server and listen for incoming connections
    # ...

    while True:
        # Handle incoming connections and data from Arduino devices
        # ...

        # Send a request to the AI model function
        request_queue.put(user_request)

        # Get the response from the AI model function
        response = response_queue.get()

        # Process the response (e.g., update animations, play voice output)
        # ...
```

Set up the communication between the main server and AI model functions:
Use Queue from the queue library to create communication channels (request and response queues) between the main server function and the AI model function.

```
from queue import Queue

request_queue = Queue()
response_queue = Queue()
```

Create and start the threads:
Create threads for the main server function and the AI model function, and start them.

```
main_server_thread = threading.Thread(target=main_server_function, args=(request_queue, response_queue))
ai_model_thread = threading.Thread(target=ai_model_function, args=(request_queue, response_queue))

main_server_thread.start()
ai_model_thread.start()

main_server_thread.join()
ai_model_thread.join()
```
This example demonstrates a basic setup where the main server function and the AI model function run in separate threads, communicating via request and response queues. By using this approach, the main server function can continue handling incoming connections and data without being blocked by the AI model's processing.
